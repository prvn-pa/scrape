As a high school and college student I took almost as many courses in literature as in science. I read Shakespeare, Yeats, Keats, Joyce, Faulkner, and Woolf. I read Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and Proust in French. In all these literature courses, I was trained to read texts; one of the tasks was to examine the words on the page, and to understand what roles those particular words were playing in generating the meaning of the piece. The premise was always that the great poets, novelists and philosophers were intentional, not accidental, in their use of language. Sometimes, the language itself was intrinsically beautiful, as when Faulkner described the physical and inner landscapes of his stories. And often, the precision of word choice and its rhythm directly conjured up understanding and illumination. Consequently, a close study of the text itself was often crucial.
Many of the problems that manuscripts encounter in peer review result from authors who know what they want to say but then fail to say it, or from reviewers who read not what has been written but what their preconceptions cause them to see. I first understood this many years ago when I read the reviews of a paper we had submitted, and angrily raged at the stupidity of the reviewer until I went back to the actual manuscript and realised that we had left some of the essential reasoning out of the paper! It was in my head, but not actually in the manuscript. Likewise, if someone else’s paper is not clear enough, I will use my own logical reasoning to fill in for what is missing, and likely not always get it right. Surely, given the importance of communicating our results, it is worth thinking about why reading and writing about science seems to be so difficult.

Word limits, page limits, figure limits, and limited attention spans have changed how we today write and publish our papers. Nonetheless, we all still aspire to tell an important and interesting story that challenges, to a large or small degree, what we know about the world. What then causes us often to write and read with far less precision than what was expected of me when I was a student? Trivially, we are frequently working under deadlines and in a hurry. But then so were some of our greatest writers, such as Dickens who published many of his novels as instalments in the newspaper, so it is not that simple. I sometimes discover a lack of clarity in my submitted papers because I have failed to confront or comprehend the essential message of the new work. The same wandering in an intellectual morass probably also occurred when I wrote about Walt Whitman as a 16-year-old, but maybe my teachers were more forgiving then than I and my colleagues are today.
There are other issues that impact how we write and read science. First, most of our scientific papers today have multiple authors. It is not uncommon that sections of papers are initially written by different people. Sometimes this is obvious to the reader, as the tone and syntax are markedly different. More critically, the implicit emphasis of how the data are presented and interpreted can be uneven, as the perspectives of the various authors are not always brought into a single voice.
Second, English is not the first language for many authors. While many of these authors write grammatically impeccable, authoritative, and elegant English (and many authors from the United States do not), there are subtle and intangible factors that can influence how well papers capture the nuances desired by authors, and how they are read. For example, when I arrived in France as a postdoc in 1975, I was amazed by the French reprint request cards. For those of you too young to have ever seen a reprint request card, in the days before the internet one would send a postcard to the author(s) of a paper to request a physical reprint. The French cards had the request in both English and French, and the latter version of the request contained about three times as many words as the English version, and was also much more polite.
As I started writing with mentees and colleagues from around the world, it became evident that every language seems to have different rules or conventions. English has an enormous vocabulary, as it has assimilated words from many other languages. Therefore, those of us for whom English is a first language were taught to express nuance with choice of word as well as syntax, as synonyms often have slightly different meanings, and even more so in a particular context. In contrast, in many languages nuance is expressed with careful crafting of syntax. In some languages, students are taught to never reuse the same word, while in good scientific English repetition often carries emphasis or an understood comparison.

Perhaps the most confounding problem we have in scientific writing comes from the fact that we frequently co-opt perfectly good words, with understood definitions in the vernacular, and give them new field-specific definitions. This even happens within different areas of neuroscience. For example, the perfectly good word ‘modulation’ has one meaning in cellular and synaptic physiology and a completely different meaning in cognitive neuroscience.
Confusion often ensues when the authors and readers bring discrepant, often subfield specific, semantic contexts, to a paper or grant they are evaluating. This happened with a recent paper in which we used the word ‘compensation’ fairly generically, only to eventually realise that a reviewer was reading it to be mean, ‘compensation resulting from a homeostatic process’, which was not what we had intended. That reviewer’s comments made no sense to us until we understood how much they were reading our manuscript with an internal model of the world that we had not intended to evoke.
It takes great discipline to read a scientific paper or other text carefully. It takes even greater discipline to write carefully and to use the full range of the language at our disposal to express our findings, especially when our own understanding of our findings is still taking shape. Above all, we should read the words on the page or screen, not the words in our head, as we read papers by other scientists and try to make sure that our own papers capture our intent.

With IN-SPACe in the Picture, What Is the Space Activities Bill’s Place?

In 2016, Sophie Jamal’s career took a turn for the worse. The bone researcher and physician was banned from federal funding for life in Canada after a committee found her guilty of manipulating data, presenting fabricated evidence to investigators, and blaming a research assistant for the fudged data. She was also ordered to pay back more than 253,000 Canadian dollars she had received in funding from the Canada Institute of Health Research. Then, in March 2018, she was stripped of her medical license.
Two years later, Jamal is back on the medical scene. According to The Toronto Sun, her medical license was reinstated after she presented evidence to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario showing that her misconduct was a direct result of her long-term mental health problems. She can now return to practicing as an endocrinologist, as long as she doesn’t conduct clinical research and continues therapy for her mental health problems.
Whether it’s fit for Jamal to return to treating patients is a matter for medical bodies and institutions in Canada to decide. What’s true is that scientists guilty of research misconduct often get away with nothing more than a slap on the wrist – that is, if they’re even caught in the first place. A survey of more than 1,100 researchers at eight European universities published earlier this year found that a large amount of research misconduct goes unreported, with early-career researchers the least likely to blow the whistle.
Part of the problem is the ambiguity around how to define research misconduct. The US Department of Health & Human Services’ Office of Research Integrity (ORI), which oversees public health research, defines it as “fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.” But other bodies and other countries have adopted different definitions, or none at all. One specialist in the area has proposed to redefine research misconduct as distorted reporting, which would cover not just the reporting of incorrect information but also the omission of vital information.
Only a small fraction of research misconduct ever comes to light. What’s more, many commonplace research misbehaviours are categorised as questionable research practices (QRPs) rather than outright misconduct. That includes publication bias, where scholarly journals favourably publish positive results over negative ones; p-hacking, where a researcher plays around with data until they meet significance thresholds; and cherry-picking, or selective reporting of data. Other QRPs include HARKing – Hypothesising After the Results are Known, where researchers search for trends in already collected data – and publishing the same study twice.
One survey published in June notes that gift authorship, where researchers who made little or no contributions to a study are included as co-authors, is perceived to be the most common type of research fraud in the US. The opposite practice, ghost authorship, where worthy authors are left off an author list, is also common. A 2019 survey of just under 500 researchers found that nearly half had ghostwritten peer reviews on behalf of senior faculty. In a recent survey of junior researchers in Australia, roughly a third of the more than 600 respondents said questionable research practices of colleagues at their institution had harmed their work.

But QRPs remain a grey area for many researchers, institutions, publishers, and funders around the world. And prevailing incentives to publish as many papers as possible, especially in flashy journals, to boost one’s odds for promotion or grant funding, actively encourage these practices.
So what can be done? To start, there needs to be a clear consensus in the global science community – including publishers, universities, academics, and funders — on what constitutes research misconduct. Only then will it be possible to clearly delineate which forms of misconduct should be criminalised, and what form the punishments should take.
Inevitably, decisions on specific punishments will need to be carried out on a case by case basis: Investigators will need to consider, for instance, the impact the misconduct may have had on human life, the amount of government funding that was wasted, and the motivations behind the wrongdoer’s actions. But a clear, generally accepted understanding of what constitutes misconduct will help to ensure that those judgements are fair.
The globally adopted definition of research misconduct, whatever it may be, should encompass QRPs. These infractions should be treated much more seriously and need to be reported by those who suffer from them or encounter them. Early-career researchers shouldn’t have to fear the consequences of making complaints about senior staff and universities should protect whistleblowers.
To that end, the responsibility for investigating research misconduct should shift from universities and institutions to independent governmental bodies. Although the U.S. has the ORI in place to oversee research integrity, most countries leave it to the research institutions to police their own staff. Those institutions often brush misconduct investigations under the carpet, fearing that public awareness of such issues would tarnish their reputations. Scientists found guilty of misconduct are rarely publicly named and often lightly punished. As a result, scientific fraudsters slip through the cracks, jumping from one institution to another, spreading bad practices and polluting the literature with subpar studies.
Independent governmental watchdog committees, by contrast, would likely be positioned to investigate cases with less bias and less fear of being sued. These committees should have enough teeth to be able to issue sanctions on researchers or universities as they deem necessary. The UK is creating a national research integrity committee, due to be launched this year, that will keep tabs on whether universities are conducting misconduct investigations robustly and appropriately. U.K. ministers have hinted that the committee could possibly be empowered to issue sanctions, but details remain scarce.
But even in the US – where the ORI does have the power to sanction malfeasant researchers by naming them, shaming them, and issuing funding bans – repeat offences happen with distressing regularity. A 2017 study of the scholarly activities of 284 academics who were found by the ORI to have committed research misconduct reported that nearly half of these researchers continued to receive federal funding after their misconduct, to the tune of more than $123 million.

In a report released this month, the European Molecular Biology Organisation, a professional organisation of life science researchers, outlined a number of options for addressing research fraud on the continent, including setting up a pan-European body to investigate breaches of research integrity on behalf of research institutions, funders, and journals. Such a committee would be a step in the right direction.
But this is a good opportunity to better science on a grander scale. By working toward a global consensus that penalises lesser research evils alongside more serious fraud, and by establishing independent bodies to enforce those penalties, we can signal to researchers, institutions and journals that what was until now considered business as usual will no longer be acceptable going forward.
